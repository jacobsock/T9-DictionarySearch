This repository demonstrates the benefits of pre-processing data in order to increase run time efficiency. 


The user is able to enter a random T-9 3 digit input, and the algorithm returns all possible words associated with the input. 

Pre-processing the original data once, allows for very efficient look ups for all words based on any given code.
